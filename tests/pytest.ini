addopts = -rsxX -l --tb=short --strict

# addopts (add commandline parameters)
# -v ... verbose: most extensive output
# --tb=short ... short traceback (file and line number)
# -l... report the local variables for every failure with the stacktrace
# -rsxX ... report the reasons for all tests that skipped, xfailed, or xpassed
# --strict disallows markers to be used if they arenâ€™t registered in a config file.

# markers = smoke

# register markers to use like @pytest.mark.smoke
# (registring markers prevents spelling errors in combination with --strict)
